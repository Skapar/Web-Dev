            <p>Something exciting happened today! I started learning HTML and CSS, and it's fascinating how much you can do with them. Here's a simple blog I created as my first project.</p>

        <div id="post2" class="post">
            <h2>Second Post</h2>
            <h6 class="date">Posted on another date in some year</h6>
            <p>Today, I delved deeper into CSS and learned about different properties like font-family, color, and line-height. It's amazing how these small changes can significantly improve the readability and aesthetics of a website.</p>
